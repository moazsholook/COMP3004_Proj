**ALWAYS PULL BEFORE DEVELOPING** 
git pull - update your local repo


after developing:

git add . - add all the files you created to your local repository
git add filename.extension - add changes made to one file only ** this is better in case you make changes to a file you didnt want to change while developing
git commit -m "" - commit your changes with a message describing what you did
git push - push your changes to the repo
